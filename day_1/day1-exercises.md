1. The purpose of HTML code is to describe the structue of a website.
2. An HTML *element* represents a section of a web page. An HTML *tag* is a symbol that indicates the beginning or end of an element. Each element consists of an opening tag and a closing tag, as well as all of the content that lies between them.
3. Attributes are used to provide more information about the contents of an HTML element.
4. The *head* element contains metadata about a page, such as the title, links to stylesheets, and scripts. The *body* element contains all of the content of the page that is displayed in the main browser window. The *title* element contains the name of the page, and will be displayed in the browser tab at the top of the window.
5. You can view the source of a website by right clicking and choosing *select*, or by using the hotkey (CMD + OPT + I).
6. Five HTML elements and what they are used for:
    1. The ```<h1></h1>``` element contains a page header. The number 1 indicates that it is a top level header. The elements ```<h2></h2>```, ```<h3></h3>```, ```<h4></h4>```, ```<h5></h5>```, and ```<h6></h6>``` are used for progressively lower level headers.
    2. The ```<b></b>``` element is used to display the text it contains in **boldface**. Similarly, the ```<i></i>``` is used to display text in *italics*.
    3. The ```<sup></sup>``` element is used to display the text it contains as superscript. Similarly, the ```<sub></sub>``` element will display the text it contains as subscript.
    4. The ```<br />``` tag is used to indicate a line break. The ```<hr />``` is similar, but creates a *horizontal rule* (line) underneath the line break.
    5. The ```<strong></strong>``` tag is used to indicate that the text it contains is important, and should be strongly emphasized. The ```<it></it>``` tag is similar, except it indicates that its contents will should be emphasized in a way that subtly changes the meaning of the sentence. Both are important so that screenreaders provide the correct emphasis.
7. An *empty element* contains no content between its opening and closing tags. It can be indicated syntactically with a single tag ending in ```/>```. Examples are the ```<br />``` and the ```<hr />``` elements.
8. *Semantic markup* is used to add extra information to a page that does not affect the page's structure. Examples include the ```<blockquote></blockquote>```, ```<abbr></abbr>```, and ```<cite></cite>``` elements. Semantic markup is important because it provides context to screenreaders, and helps search engines associate quotations to pages.
9. HTML 5 introduced new semantic elements meant to help indicate the purpose of sections of the page. Some of these new elements are:
    1. The ```<header></header>``` element indicates that a section displays introductory content, such as a heading, a logo, and search form, or a nav bar.
    2. The ```<article></article>``` element is meant to contain an independent section of a page. Examples include blog posts, news articles, or a forum post.
    3. The ```<aside></aside>``` element contains content that is indirectly related to the other content or the page. Examples might include side bars or call out boxes.
    4. The ```<footer></footer>``` element contains content at the end of a page. It typically has information about the author, copyright information, and links to related pages.
