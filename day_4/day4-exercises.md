## Images HTML

1. In an image element, the `alt` attribute is important because it provides backup content if the image does not load from the server. It also provides screen readers with content to present visually impaired users. 
2. If the image is inside of the tags for a block level element, such as a paragraph, then the image is treated as inline, and other contents of that element will flow around the image. If the image is not inside of a block level element, then it is treated as a block element, and the next element is displayed on the next line.
3. Images should use the `.jpg` extension when many different colors are present. They should instead use the `.png` extension when there are large areas comprised of the same color.

## Images CSS

1. Specifying the height and width of images in CSS as opposed to HTML is beneficial because it separates the image sizes from the HTML content. For example, the dimensions of many images can be changed simultaneously if they are all given a CSS class that sets their height and width properties.
2. An image sprite is a single image that is used in several parts of a webpage. It is useful because the server only needs to send the image once, which reduces load times.
